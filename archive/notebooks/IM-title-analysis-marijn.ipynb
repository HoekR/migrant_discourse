    "One consequence of this is that meaningful differences between a word with an initial uppercase that is part of a name (like _Migration_ in the organisation name _Internationl Committee for European Migration_) is merged with the regular noun _migration_. But in most cases this is not a problem, as they represent the same concept. Moreover, titles of journal article tend to use title casing of all words in the title, or at least all content-bearing words (i.e. non-stopwords). So it is difficult to make this distinction with algorithmic processing anyway.\n",
