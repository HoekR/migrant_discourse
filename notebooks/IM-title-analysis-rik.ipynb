    "\n",
    "To analyse the topics of discourse, we use the article titles. To do a content analysis, some data transformations are needed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- standardising the use of upper and lowercase characters,\n",
    "- removing common stopwords, as they convey nothing about the topics discussed\n",
    "- counting individual words and sequences of words as a quantitative signal for the attention to different topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We look specifically at:\n",
    "\n",
    "- word unigram frequencies: how often individual words occur across titles\n",
    "- word bigram frequencies: how often combinations of two words occur across titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the need for the transformations described above, we look at the first 20 titles."

    "\n",
    "The titles differ in their use of upper and lower case, so one step is to normalise all titles to be lower case. \n",
    "\n",
    "One consequence of this is that meaningful differences between a word with an initial uppercase that is part of a name (like _Migration_ in the organisation name _Internationl Committee for European Migration_) is merged with the regular noun _migration_. But in most cases this is not a problem, as they represent the same concept. Moreover, titles of journal article tend to use title casing of all words in the title, or at least all content-bearing words (i.e. non-stopwords). So it is difficult to make this distinction with algorithmic processing anyway.\n",
