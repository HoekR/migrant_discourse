    "# Analysing Topical Shifts in Migration Publication via Title Words\n",
    "\n",
    "The titles of publications on migration management give us an overview of what the scientific community focused in their research over the decades.\n",

    "The dataset consists of authors, titles and publication year of articles published in the journal International Migration (IM) over the period 1961-2011. \n",

    "We use Content Analysis as a method to investigate topical shifts in the discourse around migration management. “Content analysis is an approach to the analysis of documents and texts (which may consist of words and/or images and may be printed or online, written or spoken) that seeks to quantify content in terms of predetermined categories and in a systematic and replicable manner.” (Bryman, 2016, p.283).\n",

But in most cases this is not a problem, as they represent the same concept. Moreover, titles of journal article tend to use title casing of all words in the title, or at least all content-bearing words (i.e. non-stopwords). So it is difficult to make this distinction with algorithmic processing anyway.\n",
