    "In 1964 the American demographer and sociologist William Petersen wrote a review article on several books on refugee studies (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/HIVHZPDF\"></cite>). Except for some studies on the German refugee problem, at that time still an important issue due to the millions of post-World War II ethnic and non-ethnic German expellees from Central and East Europe on German soil, Petersen also reviewed the first issue of a new journal called _International Migration: Quarterly review on the role of migratory movements in the contemporary world_ (IM). The journal was ‘sponsored’ by the so called Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration (ICEM) and was in fact a merger between two journals: ICEM’s own journal Migration and the bulletin of the so called Research Group for European Migration Problems (REMP), the _REMP-bulletin_. Petersen praised the high scientific quality of one of the REMP-monographs he also reviewed, but he was extremely critical about this first journal issue. He not just saw the efforts of the Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration to assist migrants to move from Europe as a mere duplication of the purposes of the in 1952 established UN High Commissioner for Refugees, he also questioned the character of the newly established journal: ‘If the first number of International Migration is a good indication, the shift from the REMP Bulletin has been one from a scholarly journal to a self-aggrandizing house organ. \\[...\\] Most of the articles are by agency officials rather than scholars.’ (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/HIVHZPDF\"></cite>) (Petersen 1964, 419-421)."

    "Interestingly enough, in 2018, the German geographer and critical IOM-expert Martin Geiger made comparable observations, as Petersen did 55 years before, that IOM strategically time and again positions itself by actively disseminating a self representation (via its website), that does not necessarily coincide with its behind-the-scenes-character or daily practices . The scholarly debate on international migration has been characterized over the past 30 years by a focus on globalization and a paradigm shift to the study of migration management. The key actors in migration management are the nation states and also the international meetings and organizations consisting of trained experts. They have become more and more the subject of current discourses around the legitimacy of technocratic governance. Geiger and Koch  (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/3CFRXHVE\"></cite>) (2018) conceptualize the ‘intergovernmental’ IOM as a ‘world organization’ as IOM has relations with both state and non-state actors, such as NGOs or civil society. This, they argue, makes it possible to analyze which actors participate in the decision-making process, how they participate, and with what authority. Although they start to describe IOM’s history from the start in 1951, their analysis of the early years and especially the 1960s remains fragmentary. Their jump to the mid 1980s leaves ICEM/IOMs historical roots understudied and especially its apparent relation with the expert group REMP, thus leaving ICEM/IOMs  technocratic character (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/3CFRXHVE\"></cite>, p.39) unexplained."

We do this by discussing the concept of ‘world organization’ used by Geiger and by operationalizing the concept of discourse coalitions, that is constellations between (academic) experts and actors in the political system who share ideas and  interact, thus strengthening each other's arguments. This will enable us to specify our main research question and to pose the additional sub questions necessary to explore digital methods to lay bare networks of technocrats shaping migration management interactively with national governments.

    "As successor of the temporary UN International Refugee Organization (IRO) in 1951, ICEM  framed itself as a  purely technical post-war refugee transport organization, but it rather was an organization that in the first decennia of its existence focused especially on stimulating migration of labour surpluses from Europe and had highly political aims that were born from a combination of the post war  ‘one world’ ideology and Cold War reality (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/MKBTDHSV\"></cite>, Ch.3; <cite data-cite=\"3655479/6T5CAR8S\"></cite>)(Van Faassen 2014, Ch.3; Parsanoglou 2015). Its twofold objectives and its non-permanent status till the end of the 1980s outside the United Nations family was probably the cause that it remained understudied by both refugee studies and international relations and migration studies for almost forty years. This changed when the scholarly debate on international migration started to concentrate on the study of migration management and researchers discovered the new global ambitions of ICEM in this field. These ambitions found their expression in a new constitution and two name changes, first the skipping of the regional ‘Europe-part’, resulting in ICM in 1980, followed by the shift from ‘intergovernmental committee’ to the more inclusive sounding ‘International organization’ IOM in 1987 when the organization also  obtained a permanent  status, which suggested a governance system in which not only states but also other non-state actors play a role (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/X56S34DQ\"></cite>)(Perruchoud 1987). Since then, a lot of critical studies on ICEM/IOM have been published. Although IOM’s genesis and early history of the 1950s is well known by now, most of them pay little or no attention  to the in-between decades,  the 1960s-1980s, and the developments in the research that was ‘sponsored’ by the organization. In this way,  scholars neglected the merger of the journals of ICEM and the till now further unnoticed  REMP research group, as well as the early critical notes on the character of ICEM and its self representation for a wider public, that William Petersen put his finger on in his review (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/HIVHZPDF\"></cite>). \n"

    "In their article, Geiger and Koch (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/3CFRXHVE\"></cite>, 27)(2018, 27) propose to conceptualize IOM as a ‘world organization’, in other words as an International Organization embedded in world society with relations with a multitude of different actors. With this new concept they follow the so-called organizational turn in the field of International Relation studies that propose to not only study ‘states’ but to broaden the focus to the organizational character of the actual organizations as well, in order to solve the lack of a firm and common theoretical framework in the critical IOM studies thus far and to get a better understanding of IOM by bringing some of the pieces of the IOM-puzzle together. The four dimensions they suggest to explore - IOM’s semantic self-description and relations to the world; its inner world (structures, processes and participation in decision making); its environmental or external relations and its role in generating world order - are without doubt suitable for a more inclusive analysis of IOM and its interorganizational networks."

    "However, given their subsequent analysis of IOM’s historical roots (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/3CFRXHVE\"></cite>, 30-32) the concept is too static without a historical dimension and does not address the issues of its genesis or the dynamics of interaction. By historicizing IOM we move away from the aggregate level of the organizational actors and break them down in their constituent historical (human) actors, their contacts and (policy) arguments. This allows us for instance to question the assumption that ‘meaningful inter-state discussions and dialogues between states and international organizations on migration are a post-Cold war phenomenon (starting 1989-90) with the exception of the European Community’ (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/3CFRXHVE\"></cite>, 31). In previous research we have shown by following internal debates between ICEM key actors that ICEM in its earlier decades already facilitated informal multilateral discussions outside Europe on international migration - including consultations with local civil society actors (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/MKBTDHSV\"></cite>)(Van Faassen 2014, esp. 308-311). The more or less finalist approach also leads to inaccuracies in the accusation that IOM is ‘catering exclusively to the restrictive interests of Global North receiving states’ (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/PL633QM8\"></cite>, as cited in <cite data-cite=\"3655479/3CFRXHVE\"></cite>, 34)(Georgi 2010, as cited in Geiger and Koch 2018, 34). This overlooks the fact that important Global North member states like the Federated Republic of (West-)Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Austria, Greece and Spain in the 1950s and 1960s still considered themselves primarily as sending states (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/A8BVBSQP\"></cite>, <cite data-cite=\"3655479/94XUYCEW\"></cite>, <cite data-cite=\"3655479/MKBTDHSV\"></cite>, <cite data-cite=\"3655479/6T5CAR8S\"></cite>)(Steinert 1995, Freund 2004, Van Faassen 2014, Parsanoglu 2015). As their concept of ‘world organization‘ is also meant to contribute to the emerging field of political sociology, we therefore combine it in this article with the concept of so-called discourse-coalitions, with reference to the argumentative turn in the field of the political sciences (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/W6F88F74\"></cite>)(Fischer and Forester 1993)."

    "Dutch political scientist Maarten Hajer (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/7A2RCVBK\"></cite>)(1995) describes a discourse-coalition in short as ‘ a group of actors who share a social construct’ and points out that discourse formation takes place on many different levels and in many different localities and that the discursive elements (narratives or storylines) have an important organizational potential, because they have an agenda setting purpose. One of the benefits of the concept according to Hajer is that it enables analysis of strategic action in the context of sociohistoric discourses and institutional practices and especially offers a tool to analyse specific issues. Below, we will demonstrate that this is the case for ‘migration management’. German historian and sociologist Lutz Raphael (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/UHF3TATW\"></cite>)(2012) uses the discourse-coalitions concept to analyse the embedding of social sciences in Western Societies and especially in politics. In his view discourse coalitions can be seen as constellations at any given time in which social scientists (experts) develop ideas ‘that strengthen the arguments of a group of actors in the political system, whose policies might, in turn, support the standing of these scientists in academia’ (paraphrase by <cite data-cite=\"3655479/W5TM5GI3\"></cite>, 8)(paraphrase by Brückweh et. al, 8). This is particularly important, as we demonstrated in our previous research that REMP was constituted and based in the Netherlands on the initiative of Dutch demographers and sociologists, who had firm connections to the Dutch Government Commissioner for Emigration Bas Haveman (1908-1979). Haveman led ICEM between 1961-1969 as the only non-American Director-General till 2018 (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/MKBTDHSV\"></cite>, <cite data-cite=\"3655479/PGU7H2H8\"></cite>)(Van Faassen 2014, 2017; Van Faassen and Hoekstra 2017). Furthermore, Lutz offers a typology consisting of varying configurations of the ‘building blocks’ of such a discourse coalition in general, that is the ideas or metaphors, the experts, the clients, the techniques or technologies used and the institutions. Different configurations that were dominant in specific periods between 1880-1980. This framework is helpful for analysing the supposedly but still insufficiently explained technocratic character of ICEM/IOM (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/3CFRXHVE\"></cite>, 39)(Geiger and Koch 2018, 39) as we will demonstrate."

    "Combining both the concepts of World Organization and discourse coalitions thus offers us the opportunity to analyse the apparent relation between the almost unknown Research Group for European Migration Problems (REMP) and ICEM/IOM. Given the merger of their journals, REMP was seemingly a part of the ‘external environment’ of ICEM/IOM. But can REMP also be seen as a discourse coalition originating in the Netherlands in the early 1950s?  In this article we want to substantiate a mutual influencing of REMP-experts and ICEM-political or administrative actors over the years through discursive elements and state that it formed the nexus between science and politics in what nowadays is called international ‘migration management’. We also will substantiate and explain how  this supposed discourse coalition developed through time."

    "We chose a mixed methods approach of close reading and distant reading using digital techniques. For digital analysis we constructed datasets based on both analogue information from archive collections and REMP-publications and long-running journals like International Migration with metadata and title content publicly available online. Writing this article for a three-layered online Journal on Digital History gave us an excellent opportunity to use and test the data scopes concept we developed in previous research (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/ABRHNR4T\"></cite>)(Hoekstra and Koolen 2018). The idea of this concept is to facilitate doing and communicating on digital research and its sources by describing the iterative steps that have to be taken to study them, by accounting for the decisions taken and make replication possible. In the following sections we first elaborate on the historical roots of REMP, ICEM and the Dutch connection and operationalize the concept of discourse coalition for this specific case to show where technocracy comes in. This gives us a clue to formulate sub questions necessary to select and compose our datasets. Following this, we present our digital sources, discuss missing links in some of them and present the methodological translation we had to make to answer our main research questions. Finally we analyse and explain our results and address the robustness of our choices."

    "Technocracy tends to present itself as ‘above politics’, but in the last decades scholars have been actively demystifying the technocratic conception of policy analysis as neutral ‘science’, thus bringing to the surface the politics that is inherent in it. (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/RD3NVU4A\"></cite>, , <cite data-cite=\"3655479/ARPE8PPK\"></cite>)(Fischer 1993; Nord 2010; Habermas 2015). Technocracy is often defined as controlling or replacing democratic deliberation, which is usually based on finding a compromise between conflicting interests,  with a more neutral sounding science-based governance discourse where political issues are more or less transformed into undisputed, technically defined ends that can be pursued through administrative means. Although Raphael (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/UHF3TATW\"></cite>)(2012) does not focus on ‘technocracy’ as such, he argues that discourse coalitions originate in the desire to make scientifically informed policy. Therefore, his suggestion to study the impact of ‘expertise’ by a combined analysis of both the networks of actors from different backgrounds in academia, administration and political parties and the networks of discourses they produce is in fact a helpful tool to unravel the technocratic character of certain issues in politics, because it lays bare how the concepts and arguments of the social and human sciences got linked to the political domain and vice-versa. Thus, Lutz argues, using the concept of discourse coalitions requires elementary prosopographic evidence (whenever available), but also a keen eye for the actual genesis of possible expert groups. Below, we first discuss the founding years of the Dutch emigration governance system, REMP and especially the predecessor of ICEM, the Provisional Intergovernmental Committee for the Movement of Migrants from Europe (PICMME). By using Lutz’ typology of the configuration of discourses and metaphors used in those periods we study the initial connections between social science expertise and international migration. This analysis gives rise to conclusions and questions about the relation between REMP and ICEM and to sub questions to select our sources and construct our datasets to answer our main research questions.

    "The merger in 1961 between the REMP-bulletin and ICEMs magazine that William Petersen reviewed coincided with the American and Australian lobby for the Dutchman Bas Haveman as the new Director-General of ICEM. Haveman was a social-democratic chemical engineer from Delft Polytechnic University who also studied law at Leiden University and had been appointed Dutch Government Commissioner for Emigration in November 1950. But both Haveman and REMP already had a history, that is important to understand the genesis of REMP. The roots of the Dutch migration policies lie at the end of the 19th and the first half of the 20th century, periods that are characterized by discourses on ‘social reform’, targeted on the ‘working poor’  (1880-1910) and ‘social engineering’ (1910-1940). According to Raphael (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/UHF3TATW\"></cite>)(2012), especially after World War I the interventions were grounded in social science research and were based on arguments concerning ‘fear of degeneration’ and - more positively formulated - ‘national recovery’, with discourses around ‘demography’ , ‘community’ or ‘eugenics'. The Dutch migration policies fit well into Raphael’s characterization of the impact of expert-influence in the Western societies in general. "

    "Although today’s polarized debates on economic migration seem to suggest otherwise, for more than a century states have considered (international) migration – and thus the regulation of it - as a sound instrument for the (re)allocation of labour. In 1913, the Netherlands Association for Resettlement (landverhuizing)  was founded, as a hybrid private-public organization. Amongst its initiators were the liberal Minister of Agriculture Willem Treub and an engineer from Delft Polytechnic University, Isaac Pieter de Vooys. Both were still working on their final report by the State Commission on Unemployment, in which they explored internal and international migration as possible solutions (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/MKBTDHSV\"></cite>)(Van Faassen 2014).  De Vooys was also part of an intellectual movement that has been described as synthetic technocracy, that was looking for  a synthesis that would bridge ideological differences and thus stop the fragmentation of Dutch society which was divided along religious lines (so called pillarization) at that time, and that paralyzed Dutch political decision-making in their view.

He developed a new research style called ‘sociography’ (the predecessor of sociology) focussing on empirical research on Dutch social groups and communities in relation to different people internationally. One of his students initiated the so-called People’s High School Movement in the Netherlands. This had comparable aims to the technocrats and attracted other Dutch  sociographers, like Evert Hofstee and Pieter Bouman who later also played a role in REMP. During the world wide economic crisis of  the 1930s the Friesland High School organized combined employment and emigration courses, thus creating the possibilities for demography-based politics. One of the teachers was Bas Haveman (the later Government commisioner), who had previously been the secretary of the “Stichting Nederlands Volkskracht” (Dutch People's Power Foundation) that aimed at moral and physical  training of unemployed youth, to prevent ‘moral decay’ and to stimulate ‘community spirit’ (gemeenschapszin) especially to bridge the then perceived gaps in mentality between city and countryside (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/MKBTDHSV\"></cite>, <cite data-cite=\"3655479/PGU7H2H8\"></cite>)(Van Faassen, 2014, Van Faassen and Hoekstra 2017)."

    "instrumental for establishing a peaceful and above all a ‘planned modernization’, in which welfare states could be extended, according to Raphael (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/UHF3TATW\"></cite>)(2012). Metaphors for this modernization discourse were ‘assimilation’ and 'adaptation’. Again the Netherlands were no exception to the general picture. Already during the war the Dutch government had started to investigate possibilities for a so-called active migration policy, emanating from a Keynesian aspiration for full employment. It based its post-World-War II socioeconomic policy on two cornerstones. In order to prevent structural unemployment, industrialization was to be encouraged. In addition, large-scale family emigration to overseas destinations was stimulated and facilitated. This not only enabled the Dutch government to manipulate the supply side of the labour market, but also to avoid the at that time unwanted demographic solutions like birth control in the still religious Netherlands, which had the highest increase in population forecast till the 1960s, due to its sky high birth rates (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/MKBTDHSV\"></cite>, <cite data-cite=\"3655479/PGU7H2H8\"></cite>)(UN Population forecast 1951; Van Faassen 2014, Van Faassen and Hoekstra 2017). Not surprisingly, when Haveman was appointed Government Commissioner for Emigration in 1950 he believed that migration policy had to be science-based and planning was only possible if he had an insight into the migration potential of the Dutch population."

He also established new acquaintances. Amongst them was the German political economist and demographer Günther Beijer, who fled to the Netherlands in 1933. Beijer was praised in Petersen’s review as the one who ‘created and sustained the Research Group for European Migration Problems’ - he was editor of the REMP-publication series till his death in 1983 - and who ‘achieved an enviable reputation among demographers’ (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/HIVHZPDF\"></cite>, 420)(Petersen 1963, 420).

Haveman met Günther Beijer when they both were introduced to the American Delegation during its stopover in The Hague, just before the start of the founding Conference of PICMME in Brussels, Belgium in november 1951, and only a few months before REMP was established in March 1952 (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/B8X95E7G\"></cite>)(IISG, collection Beijer, inv.nr. 33)."

This interconnectedness is of importance for recognizing some of the technocratic arguments that accompanied the establishment of PICMME/ICEM, to better understand its longtime existence outside the UN as well as the Dutch influence in ICEM. The Netherlands took an active part in the international emigration debate after World War II, in which every country had its own agenda, while humanitarian and economic arguments concerning manpower became inseparably linked to arguments on collective security due to quickly deteriorating East-West relations.  Another element of Haveman’s job was strengthening international contacts. He acquired his first international experience as a social-economic expert in the Dutch delegation to the United Nations (UN) as a member of the Special Committee on Refugees and Displaced Persons, that  set up the International Refugee Organization (IRO) in 1946, a temporary UN-agency in which the Eastern (communist) European countries decided not to participate. In this role Haveman worked closely with United States (US) delegate George L. Warren, who was the State Department’s advisor on refugees and later became the head of the American delegation to ICEM till the mid-1960s (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/MKBTDHSV\"></cite>, <cite data-cite=\"3655479/QGLAUNK7\"></cite>)(Van Faassen 2014, 2017)."

    "In the early 1950s, it was unclear which international institutions would regulate and be able to finance refugee and migrant flows. By the time the mandate of the IRO had expired at  the end of the 1940s the refugee problem had still not been resolved. The UN subsequently decided to establish the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), but with only a small administrative budget and at first without an operational mandate  (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/N6J5DKMR\"></cite>, <cite data-cite=\"3655479/BN3VJMLV\"></cite>)(Salomon 1991, Zieck 1997). Due to Cold War considerations and the ‘white’ migration policies of Canada and Australia, the Western countries were also looking for a continuation of the IRO services outside of the UN system with its communist and ‘non-white’ member states. The International Labour Organization tried to enhance its position by arguing that migration traditionally was a ‘labour-’ issue and therefore should ressort under ILO. In 1951, Haveman convinced the Dutch government that ILO should not emerge as winner of the battle over the IRO’s material legacy (the fleet, personnel and an administrative budget augmented by a US bonus of ten million dollars), even though the current social-democratic Dutch government initially favoured the ILO option because of the tripartite composition of its governing and plenary bodies with union and employers delegates. Haveman informed the Dutch government that during his travels to Canada and Australia, he had experienced resistance to ILO interference due to the non-Western input that was difficult to combine with the de facto white migration policy of both countries. Haveman had also been in touch with Warren and learned that the US Congress would not finance any operational ILO migration work due to strong anti-ILO forces in US domestic politics. As a result the Netherlands supported the solution,  of allocating the IRO legacy for one year to the PICCME, which was instigated and presented by US Congressman Francis E. Walter at the conference in Brussels in November 1951.  "

    "PICMME presented itself as purely a transport organization for refugees and displaced persons, temporarily offering technical solutions for what was publicly stressed as a humanitarian problem. However, internally the member states had agreed that its main function was to encourage and facilitate the economic migration of labour surplus from a disrupted Europe, giving  this ‘depoliticized’ agreement in fact a highly political background. The preference for bilateral contacts on migration remained, while at the same time ICEM facilitated multilateral discussions without asking for too much collective commitment from the member states because of its temporary status outside the UN-system. Therefore, in the long run it could even function as a safety valve for an integrating Europe: the moment the free movement of people within Europe actually would be regulated  - in which Germany and the Netherlands would likely become the ‘receiving’ countries - this inflow could be compensated by facilitating the overseas emigration of their own nationals using PICMME / ICEM facilities  (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/MKBTDHSV\"></cite>, <cite data-cite=\"3655479/6T5CAR8S\"></cite>)(Van Faassen 2014, Parsanoglou 2017). One of the advantages of this ‘light’ construction was that PICMME’s and from 1953 onwards  ICEM’s Executive Board, on which the Netherlands had an almost permanent seat until the 1970s, was only accountable to its own Council and thus could stay under the radar of the national parliaments.

    "The day in november 1951 that Günther Beijer met Haveman at the US embassy in the Hague, Beijer was invited to inform Congressman Walter and the other American delegates about the plans he had developed since May 1950 to establish an international research group on European migration and refugee problems. This group, which would eventually become the Research Group of European Migration Problems (REMP) in 1952, initially was a bilateral Dutch-German initiative. Günther Beijer at that moment still was the only formal Dutch representative together with the German Bildungsökonom (education economist) Friedrich Edding, who worked at the Institut für Weltwirtschaft in Kiel. The aims of the research group was to find solutions for the fact that - in their analysis - the relations between population density, the age distribution, the labour potential and the national earning capacity had become so stressed in the second half of the 1940s, that there was a serious risk of social unrest that could endanger prosperity and that could only partially be solved on a national basis. As these Dutch and German researchers were ‘convinced that the integration of the national economies must be accompanied by free migration of labour’, they decided to join forces in order to investigate possible migration problems within Europe. The first studies were published in the spring of 1951 and offered to the US-delegation during the november meeting. Beijer stressed that the idea was to extend this research group ‘by inviting personalities from all nations, who are ready and able, by their scientific qualifications and practical experience, to co-operate on a basis free of national, party political and confessional bias’ (all citations IISG, collection Beijer, inv.nr.33) (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/B8X95E7G\"></cite>).

    "In March 1952 the Research Group was formally established in The Hague. Beijer was appointed secretary and editor-in-chief. The Dutch sociographer Pieter Bouman, professor at Groningen University and personal friend of Government Commissioner Haveman, had been appointed to form the first board of directors. The provisional managing committee consisted of the Utrecht professor and sociographer Sjoerd Groenman and the catholic economist and sociographer professor George Zeegers. In its Mission Statement, REMP highlighted the ‘threat of overpopulation’ for the future prosperity of mankind. Regional unemployment and a falling standard of living could be the results of the disproportional distribution of humanity over the earth. They considered it ‘the imperative duty of scientists and statesmen …to concern themselves with these local disharmonies, by studying them and if possible by indicating solutions to the present difficulties’ (IISG, collectie Beijer, inv.nr. 30) (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/B8X95E7G\"></cite>).

    " In July 1952 the Research Group organised its first international meeting to discuss its initial plans as expressed in a working paper. As Beijer had been invited by the Americans before the PICMME conference, in return the American Porter Jarrell was invited as an observer on behalf of Pierre Jacobsen, the deputy director of PICMME. He resolutely amended the REMP’s intended research plans, which were primarily focussed on intra-European migration. First he outlined PICMME’s activities: organising migrant transportation via field offices in Germany, Austria, Italy, Trieste and via chartered shipping from the Netherlands to Australia, Brazil, the USA and Venezuela and participating in bilateral agreements. Then he concluded that being so close to the day to day operation, PICMME realised that it might lose sight of the larger demographic implications of its work and therefore looked forward to the scientific studies of the Research Group ‘as possible guideposts for our program in the future’. However, to his view the Research Group was too much confined to intra-European migration only, probably because of ‘a certain distrust of overseas emigration as a cause for the weakening of the basic demographic structure of Europe.’ Jarrell argued that this was not necessary as both sending and receiving states were represented in PICMME. Thus PICMME offered the opportunity to counteract this danger by experimenting with the development of certain flexible controls concerning size, direction and composition of the outflow: ‘If the Research Group were to consider overseas migration it could well recommend to the various governments the nature of the “flexible controls” which might prove scientifically desirable’. The day after Jarrell left the conference Beyer sent him a letter to confirm that the REMP members fully shared Jarrell’s view and would also take overseas emigration into account as an object for study and advice.

    "It can be concluded not only that the actual founding of REMP and PICMME coincided, but, via the Dutch connection, also that the mutual lobbying and influencing already started during the formative months. The initial discourses concerning labour, population density and demography indicate that the historical actors concerned believed in a makeable welfare society, in which one possible instrument was social engineering via regulating quantity and type of in- and outflow within the respective national populations of the member states. In the Netherlands this was called ‘guided (geleide migratie)’ or ‘planned migration’ (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/5SKCBEUV\"></cite>)(Petersen 1955) and part of the ‘planned modernization’ discourse, as defined by Raphael (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/UHF3TATW\"></cite>). However, with Raphael’s remarks on prosopographic evidence in mind, to really substantiate that this expert group in the long run formed a discourse coalition on ‘migration management’ and to be able to discover and explain shifts in the presumed networks of actors and discursive elements, we have to establish who were the key scientists involved, and who were the key political actors. How were they connected to the key political actors and institutions mentioned above? And finally: what were the topics of this discourse and how did they develop? In the next section we reflect on the choices of sources and data and on the methodological choices we had to make to start answering these questions."

    "In the datasets, there are 2540 records. Most of the people in the migration managment discourse network (98,4 percent) were authors, while 2.8 percent were on the governing boards of either REMP or ICEM. Only 1.2 percent were active in governance and were authors as well. Our datasets allow us to analyse the evolution of the network over time to a limited extent, as the REMP network decreases in activity after 1970 and as we have much less detailed data about the ICEM network in which the REMP discourse coalition was absorped. The analysis per decade in figure 5 therefore has an emphasis on the 1950s and 1960, when the REMP discourse coalition was most active. REMP founder Günter Beijer was active from the start in 1952 until his death in 1983, but he was followed by other academics and organizers. Australia-based Reginald Appleyard, for instance, appeared in the REMP network in the 1960s, and remained active in the ICEM network as editor of International Migration until the 1990s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Haveman became ICEM director in the early 1960s, but his predecessors and followers were not Dutch. On the basis of the national provenance of the people in the network of REMP and ICEM it can be concluded that REMP was predominantly (though not exclusively) Dutch oriented in the 1950s, but got more international in the 1960s and even more so in later decades. We have visualized the nationalities of the people in the discourse coalition networks in different decades, as far as we were able to track these down (figure 6). Especially for the later decades, our data about nationalities mostly comprise the administrators in the network, so overall conclusions cannot be very firm. It is clear, however, that the importance of the Netherlands decreased over time and that the network got more international and operated under auspices of ICEM. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is mirrored in the scientific output of the discourse coalition, as the REMP publications decreased in number over the years. As we have outlined above, the REMP bulletin merged into the ICEM sponsored _International Migration_ journal. But it was also a result of the changing nature of migration in the Netherlands, that changed from an emigration country in the 1950s and 1960s to a mostly immigration country from the 1970s. The Netherlands shared this change with much of Europe. At the ICEM sponsored ‘Seminar on \"The Role of International Migration in the Development of Modern Society”' in Turin on 14 and 15 October 1961, the French technocrat and at the time chair of the REMP-board Alfred Sauvy remarked that \"[s]ince the discovery of the New World, migrations have traditionally been from Europe, a developed region, to [...] America, Africa and, to a far less extent, to Asia. We are therefore confronted with an unexpected reversal of the migration flow [...] which no one at all had foreseen ten years ago\" (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/4X34EF3B\"></cite> preliminaries_2009, 21-22). This was in the years that Haveman was ICEM director and leads us to the discourse part of the migration management discourse network."

    "It is tempting to conclude from the decrease of the network that it fell apart and that the discourse coalition disappeared in the 1980s, but we argue that that is not the case. Rather, the explicit involvement of adminstrators in the network became less prominent and the discussion shifted to the academic part of the network. We know from the Beijer archive that at the end of the 1960s, beginning of the 1970s there was a dip in the REMP/IM activities and that he established contacts with IMR-editors, which also shows in the data. This also applies to Beijers Australian successor Appleyard.  At the same time, policy making strategies in ICM/IOM migration management was increasingly handed over to regional activities in the public domain in collaboration with think tanks and consultancy agencies, mostly on border control with biometrical instrument that were neither part of academia nor of public administration, and certainly contributed to a new phase in technocracy (Cf. <cite data-cite=\"3655479/LQ8F88BC\"></cite> Klekowski von Koppenfels 2001, 72, 78-80; <cite data-cite=\"3655479/42V6U65E\"></cite> Andrijasevic & Walters 2010, 988, esp. note 17). They were informed by and participated in the ongoing discourse about migrant management. Because these agencies have no obligation for public accounting, as they perform their studies for political or administrative actors that do no longer directly interact with research, but are indirectly still informed by it. While it became harder to follow the administrative part of the discourse coalition in the datasets we used, we can still observe its research part as this continued in the same academic journals as before.

    "The overall subject of the discourse in the discourse coalition was **the ‘planning’ and ‘guiding’ or in today’s words** the management of migration. As we wrote above, migration in the early 1950s, when both REMP and ICEM and its predecessors were founded, was mainly about emigration from Europe. In the course of time this changed as Sauvy tentatively remarked in the early 1960s quoted above. Sauvy had a similar background as Haveman being educated at the Ecole Polytechnique and was a member of the French technocratic X-crise group and described by Nord as a 'decisionmaker'  (<b style=\"color:red;\">Add citation</b> Nord 2010). Without going into the details, it is obvious he was right, and there was a change in migration streams in which Europe became an immigration area, instead of mainly an emigration area. It is also obvious that these changes in migration would have their influence on the discourse about migration management. In this section, we will analyse this evolution.\n"

Moreover, it is not clear whether there were conscious or unconscious (or both) changes in the editorial policies for keywords. Therefore, we decided the wordclouds of Worldcat for our purposes should be regarded as artefacts constructed by Worldcat and could not be regarded as reliable qualifications of the discourse and its evolution.

    "For our analysis of the discourse we have used other sources, of both a qualitative and a quantitative nature. The main sources we used are the articles in the _International Migration_ (IM) journal published under ICEM (and later IOM) sponsorship (datasource VI in the diagram above). As a comparison, we used the _International Migration Review_ (IMR) journal, with a comparable general migration scope and published in roughly the same period as _International Migration_ but  independent from ICEM. The aim of the comparison is to see whether the academic content of both journals was mainly determined by either developments in migration or those in the migration studies academic field or whether there was a lasting influence of ICEM/IOM sponsorship.\n",

IM also contains a number of anonymous (un-authored) contributions that we excluded from this quantitative analysis. We did not use the article fulltext, as we had no access to fulltext, but also because in our opinion the titles can be regarded as a means to engage in discourses, as they are the first and primary means to attract the attention of the readers of the journal. \n"

    "For the qualitative analysis, we used the anonymous articles in IM, under the assumption that anonymous articles were meant as a collective statement. Upon closer inspection, it appeared that this was indeed the case, as apart from review articles, bibliographies and a single obituray, they were mostly reports from ICEM conventions, that were held irregularly over the years. The close reading of these editorial articles offers an opportunity to explore the way ICEM conceptualized the relationship between science, **policymaking** and governance. Therefore we start by outlining these discussions and use a quantitative analysis of the journal titles to confirm or amend this qualitative analysis."

In 1962 Haveman wrote that in 1961 there had been a ‘Seminar on \"The Role of International Migration in the Development of Modern Society” It took place in Turin on 14 and 15 October I961 and was organized by the Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration, with the co-operation and assistance of the Italian authorities.’ (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/MSDRDKEC\"></cite>, Havemean 1962) **Its scientific director was the statistician and REMP-board member Giusippe Parenti.** Contrary to later seminars, it included exclusively academic speakers and did not end in concrete policy recommendations.\n",

    "The purpose of the seminars is very clearly stated in 1979 **in what already was the fith seminar on this topic  (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/4RB6A474\"></cite>):** “The ICEM Seminars on Adaptation and Integration of Permanent Immigrants are intended as a forum for an exchange of views and experience in the field of migrant adaptation and integration between representatives of governments and international governmental and non-governmental organizations concerned with migration. The Seminars usually deal with two main subjects, divided into sub-topics, i.e. individual aspects, which are analysed and discussed on the basis of working papers prepared by experts on the subject matters chosen. In addition, governments and international organizations contribute information documents reflecting their own experiences and/or policies in those fields. General and specific recommendations on each sub-topic are formulated by the participants for guidance and action on a national or international level respectively.”  And it also gives an insight into the preparation of a Seminar: “The programme for this Seminar was prepared by a Working Group under the chairmanship of Mr. Rent Fourdin, Director General of the Chancellery, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Belgium. The Working Group was composed of the Government Representatives of Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Israel, Italy, Portugal, Turkey and the United States of America. [...] Experts from Australia, Belgium, France, Italy, Portugal, the Netherlands, Spain,Switzerland, Turkey and the U.S.A. prepared 11 working documents on the above-mentioned subjects and acted as discussion leaders during the Seminar.”\n",

    "The desirability of a close connection between research and **policymaking** is affirmed over and over. The first explicit mention is in 1963, when the editorial stated that “Thanks to [a growing number of migration]  studies, a greater knowledge has been acquired of the many aspects of the migration process and thus it has been possible for the immigration countries to establish the conditions which will allow their immigration policies to succeed.” (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/QMQKWK6U\"></cite>) At the time much attention was devoted to migration in Latin America. The second 1963 editorial referred to ICEM policies regarding agricultural productivity: “Many of the programmes which the Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration has established to assist its Latin-American Member Governments are precisely designed to help with these problems. ICEM’S policy in the agricultural field is therefore designed to select and resettle small groups of skilled European farmers trained in up to date techniques of agricultural production.” (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/6DFSR6FZ\"></cite>) **From previous research we know that Haveman during his ICEM-directorship had a special focus on stimulating selective European migration to Latin America, as can also be concluded from the 1964 editorial, which reported on the biannual ICEM Council- Session that was mainly concerned with Latin America (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/32E77X2A\"></cite>).  The entanglement of research and policy was made explicit when from 1965 onwards Dutch farmers were subsidized by the Dutch Government (ministery of development cooperation) to migrate to Latin-America as expert-migrants (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/MKBTDHSV\"></cite>Van Faassen 2014, 391-398).** \n",

    "An explicit connection between research and governance was made in 1976.  **In the recommendations of the second ICEM Seminar, which from then on included representatives from governments, international and non-governmental organizations as well as experts, thus developing itself further in what Geiger now conceptualizes as a world organization.** The first point was: “The establishment of a body of statistical data could be instrumental in coping with the range of problems concerning migration and more particularly family migration and/or family reunion. Such data are seen as an essential element also at the policy making level. There is therefore a great need for research both at the national and at the international level and governments are urged to take appropriate measures to make such research possible. Methods of data collection should not, however, make more difficult or increasingly hamper the movement of people across frontiers.” (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/4V8R7EWF\"></cite>) After that, the need for better statistics for policy making was explicitly repeated in all the Seminar recommendations in almost the same words. And in 1983 the Seminar even recommended that “ICM, in collaboration with other organizations, should be encouraged to establish pilot case studies to research this phenomenon. These could serve as an input for regional discussions.” (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/ADTMZT7F\"></cite>)\n",

    "It is remarkable that there is only an explicit call for statistical research. When in 1979 the topic of the Seminar was the adaptation of child migrants, the Seminar concluded that “scientific analysis and research in the field of the socio-psychology of the children of migrants has produced a whole range of very divergent data.” (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/4RB6A474\"></cite>) and that “There was a strong feeling that the results of this research are badly in need of being integrated and collated.” But immediately following this, the Seminar warned that “considering that the socialization problems of migrant children in the host country are conditioned by their economic, social and legal status in that country, the Seminar has drawn attention to the dangers of an excessive intrusion of psychology into the problems of the children of migrants.” This is the only instance when another field of research than statistics or demography was mentioned. \n",

    "The datasets used for the analysis (IV, V, VI and VII in the diagram above) contain a total of 4,282 article titles, divided over 762 _REMP_ and _International Migration_ (IM) titles and 1678 _International Migration Review_ (IMR) titles. IMR also contains 1842 reviews of literature, that we left out of the comparison. The total number of articles increased from 100 in the 1950s to 1,490 in the 1990s. The IM set is smaller than the IMR set, but the rate varies. In the 1950s we have no IM and IMR titles and only 100 for REMP, so trends for this decade are tentative. In the 1960s the ratio between IM and IMR was 0.84 (i.e.IM published 0.84 articles per 1 article in IMR) and after that it changed to 0.30 in the 1970 to approximately 0.5 in the 1980s and 1990s. IMR research is dominant in the total numbers, but we use IMR mainly to see how trends in IM differ from the more general trends, so therefore we will often present a graph of both IM and general (IM+IMR) developments. \n",

    "Tracing topics in literature is difficult and subject to interpretation issues in every way. For trend analysis the relatively small word set made using with word counts good enough for our purposes; the method has the advantage of being transparent. Two thirds of individual words in titles only occurred once, so we classified title words into somewhat bigger topics by hand; the classi. Below, our analysis refers to these topics.  \n",
    "We manually identified topics and constructed word lists per topic by searching through the titles, inspired by the topic categories defined in the UCREL Semantic Analysis System (<cite data-cite=\"3655479/LN4UKSH7\"></cite>, <cite data-cite=\"3655479/YX3ERH3B\"></cite>)(Wilson 1993, Archer et al. 2002). One set of topics covers directions of migration, another set focuses on aspects of management, a third on forms of migration and a fourth set on academic discplines. The graphs were all made by calculating the fraction of all title words that belong to a specific topic, for five year periods, starting from 1950 until 2000, increasing the start and end of the period by one year in each step (1950-1954, 1951-1955, 1952-1956, etc)."

    "In a corpus like this, it comes as no surprise that the most common terms include (variants of) \"migration\". As figures 7 (terms in IM) and 8 (total terms) show, _emigration_ was more common in the 1960s, while _immigration_ was used more often later on, although there was a concentration in the mid-1960s. The term _migration_ was not used very frequently throughout the whole period, though its use increased slightly over the years. Of course, the terms _emigration_ and _immigration_ depend on the perspective, because what is immigration for one country is emigration for another. However, in general immigration causes more and more lasting changes. In our qualitative analysis of the discourse above, we have already seen how researchers and politicians used emigration to mean European emigration, while immigration (or migration) was the term commonly used for other contexts, although it was increasingly used for Europe as well. The quantitative title analysis of the titles confirms this."

    "As this is a discourse coalition about migration management, the next aspect to consider is the extent to which management words played a role in the discourse. Management has a changing vocabulary, but we tried to single out the most important terms. From figure 10 it appears that overall there was a growing interest in management related issues, but overall in IMR discussions about decision making were more important than the other two topics throughout the entire period. This confirms our idea that the ICEM liaison of IM had an influence on its discussions. The topics that the titles referred to shifted from a process to a decision making orientation, in both journals but more so in IM. Without further research, it is hard make any definitive interpretions of this shift, but it seems to be indicative for a shift from an approach of migration management as interacting with migration to a more control oriented approach."

    "Taken as a whole, there no remarkable difference in the content of the articles of IM and IMR. Over the years the relative proportion of articles that cover a specific topic drops, which may be a sign that the diversity of topics increases, or that terminology diversifies. As an example we have taken the topic of labour migration. Labour in relation to migration was important from the start in both IM and IMR and always remained so. The varying trends in both journals does show that there were dynamics in the scientific discussions in both journals that did not coincide, but without close reading it is impossible to give any more specifics about them (figure 11).

    "However, there is another important difference between IM and IMR in the disciplines that were represented in the articles. Both journals are general social science migration journals without any specific disciplinary orientation. In both IM and IMR sociology was important. In the early years economics dominated titles in REMP, but after the late 1950s this subsided and many disciplines were represented, with some emphasis on pyschology in the 1980s. Demography was never important in IMR, but in IM it was always present, while in IMR statistics were always present, and in IM it was only present as a separate subject in the 1980s. In IM psychology got a lot of attention in the late 1960s and early 1970s, but after that psychology was much less of a topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "This overview presents some trends, that confirm the general social science nature of both journals, though mainly the social sciences that make heavy use of statistics and statistical methods. Anthropology, for instance, is not part of the discussions in either IM or IMR, even if there is much anthropological research about migration and its impact on migrant groups. The disciplinary topics are, of course, not sharpely separated. For instance, demographics and statistics are closely related, while sociology and economics provide much of the theoretical framework for other social sciences. However, some of the analysis of the qualitative discussion sheds some light on this quantitative approach. As we have seen, up until the 1970s in IM there was a lasting presence of demographers and statistically oriented researchers that in the ICEM conferences persistently called for funding of statistical research, while they then cut short the influence of psychological research, especially in the report of the 1979 conference report. Even before that psychology was not prominent as a topic in the titles anymore."

    "The discourse coalition on migration management came into being in the early 1950s when in the Netherlands Günter Beijer founded the Research Group for European Migration Problems and at the same time the precursor of ICEM was founded as a **temporary intergovernmental committee** for the transportation of migrants. **In the public presentation the focus was on refugees, but internally it was explicitly also mentioned for European labour** emigrants and still later on **even more** diverse groups of migrants. REMP had its roots in the planning-oriented governance circles in the Netherlands, Europe and the World and from its inception included both international researchers and administrators. The aim was to control migration by founding it on research and scientific insights, mainly demography and sociology, due to the orientation of the researchers involved. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the late 1950s throughout Europe there was less orientation on emigration and in the 1960s the discourse coalition altered. Orientation became more international and research became more closely allied with ICEM when Bas Haveman became its director and the ICEM supported journal _International Migration_ became the main venue for research. The research group became still more internationaly oriented during Beijer's long dominant position. The researchers were the think tank for ICEM as well, but migration changed when increasing labour migrants started coming to Europe and the numbers of European emigrants decreased. Still, in ICEM governance circles and its associated research group, there remained a perceived need for the management of migration based on insights from research. Notwithstanding the changes in migration, research orientations remained by and large the same and predominantly oriented to statistically founded social science. Growing influences from other social sciences, mainly psychology, were largely cut short in the late 1970s. The control set of IMR shares many of the same orientations, but there seems to be more room for other voices, mainly a lasting interest in psychology. The calls in the conference reports for funding for statistical research give the impression of a group that was striving to maintain its position. \n",
    "\n",
    "The discourse coalition that came into being in the 1950s proved to found a lasting relation between governance of migration and the research on which it founded itself. While migration itself changed constantly, the basic orientation of both research and governance remained remarkably constant in a focus on the migration streams and the control of them and much less concerned with either the motivations behind migration or the effects on the migrants. **Remarkebly enough, IOM today still caters the outward movement in its voluntary return programs, but their subjects are not the European born nationals anymore. At the same time IOM proved to be succesfull in -at least the suggestion of-  involving more and more different kind of actors in its policy-programming throughout the years, thus developing itself in what can be seen as a  world organization.** The discourse coalition therefore evolved over time, but remained constant in its conception about the relation between research and governance. This is not to say that research was not independent, but the result was that it was hard to influence the discourse from outside the coalition, **a direction that Petersen seemed to recognize already in 1963.**"
