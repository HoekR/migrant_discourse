    "As argued in the [network research questions](.NetworksResearchQuestions.pynb), identifying a discourse coalition consists of two parts. The first is establishing the network and the links between public administrators and researchers, which we treated in the network notebooks, and the second is identifying the discourse they engaged in. \n",
    "As exposed in the network analysis, in the case of migration managment there was network that evolved for fifty years, at least. While the discourse was about the managment of migration, this changed with the world and migration. Migration itself is a very broad phenomenon, so in the discourse we want to investigate two things:\n",
