    "We assume there is a discourse coalition of social scientists and public officials from the 1950s through the 1980s. Marijke put the assumptions as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumption:** REMP is an informal association of social scientists that is must closer to political policy making (both national and international) than was previously known from the literature. This would make it an informal technocratic association, because of the association and the exchange of knowledge between public administrators and scientists. On the one hand this makes administration (in this case migration management) supposedly more rational because it is based on research and scientific insights. But at the same time, this kind of technocratic associations\n",
    "\n",
    "- make policy making less transparant and less subject to democratic checking point of view and\n",
    "- science may be used as a justification of politically motivated motives; assuming that the research itself still conforms to scientific standards, it is relevant to compare the choice of subjects with the political agenda.\n",
    "\n",
    "Researching the discourse coalition consists of two parts. We first have to make it probable that there were networks that together can be considered to form a discourse coalition because of the involvement of both researchers and admistrators. After the existence of this association is made likely, we can investigate what research content was produced in the networks. Both REMP and ICEM published journals and other research. To see if and how it was influenced by the REMP/ICEM discourse coalition, we will compare it with contemporary research about migration from a journal that was not associated with either REMP or ICEM. (XXX should we translate this to steps??)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**from concept to research strategy**\n",
    "A discourse coalition is a concept, an analytical construct that is used to characterize a perceived association between researchers and public administrators based on discursive characteristics. It may to be methodologically constructed from available evidence in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- by close reading archival materials in which the association betweeen public administrators and researchers is mentioned, either implicitly or explicitly. \n",
    "- by measuring the association between researchers and public administrators in one or more networks. In this case, we are talking about several networks as migration management was a long running an increasingly international issue that had to face challenges that changed over the years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our research materials consist of both types of materials. The archival materials that lend themselves for close reading mainly stem from the early 1950s (XXX make explicit: archive Beyer, REMP, sociale zaken?). ICEM and its successor IOM are international organizations, of which the archives are essentially closed for researchers. As it is, from the REMP archives it is clear that both REMP and ICEM originated at the same time in the early 1950s and in their inception involved many of the same people, even if they were separate organizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have different long-running datasets that make it possible to establish the overlap between the different organizations involved. Because we are talking about a research-adminstrative coalition the datasets are from research and from the administration, that is the relevant boards and governments involved with REMP and ICEM. As researchers publish, covering scientific output is more fine-grained than administrative positions.\n",

    "**Landmark years:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1952 formal foundation of REMP (Beyer / sociologists like Hofstee); sociologists have an important influence on Dutch emigration from the moment of appointment of Haveman (nov.1950); it is integrated into the work of the _Commissariaat voor de Emigratie_ by way of _Studies over NL emigratie_ (excel)\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1958-1962 publication of the most important Dutch emigration studies (supporting policies)\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1961-1967 Haveman director-general of ICEM (with the help of USA en Australie). In this period there is a shift in the political debate from emigration as a result of 'surplus labour from Europe' and 'overpopulation Europa' to 'development aid and Latijns Amerika. In NL a ministry of Development Cooperation is established that the Farming Lobby once again uses to finance emigration by farmers from their support group (now known as knowledge migration). NL  closely follows USA policies in this respect and Haveman is partially responsible for the execution. Attention shifts to Latin America in ICEM, inspired by Haveman (= knowledge based on archival research) \n",

As the different datasets contain only a part of the network, they either contain information about the academic or the governance activities.
