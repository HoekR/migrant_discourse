    "We assume there is a discourse coalition of social scientists and public officials from the 1950s through the 1980s. Marijke put the assumptions as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumption:** REMP is an informal association of social scientists that is must closer to political policy making (both national and international) than was previously known from the literature, making it a informal technocratic association. The issue at stake is how transparant this kind of technocratic associations are from a democratic checking point of view. \n",

    "**Landmark years:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1952 formal foundation of REMP (Beyer / sociologists like Hofstee); sociologists have an important influence on Dutch emigration from the moment of appointment of Haveman (nov.1950); it is integrated into the work of the _Commissariaat voor de Emigratie_ by way of _Studies over NL emigratie_ (excel)\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1958-1962 publication of the most important Dutch emigration studies (supporting policies)\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1961-1967 Haveman director-general of ICEM (with the help of USA en Australie). In this period there is a shift in the political debate from emigration as a result of 'surplus labour from Europe' and 'overpopulation Europa' to 'development aid and Latijns Amerika. In NL a ministry of Development Cooperation is established that the Farming Lobby once again uses to finance emigration by farmers from their support group (now known as knowledge migration). NL  closely follows USA policies in this respect and Haveman is partially responsible for the execution. Attention shifts to Latin America in ICEM, inspired by Haveman (= knowledge based on archival research) "
